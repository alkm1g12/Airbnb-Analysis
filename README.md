Rendered version can be viewed [here](https://github.com/alkm1g12/Airbnb-Analysis/blob/master/output/Airbnb.md)

This is a project analysing the Airbnb London listings dataset, to observe the effect that different types of litsings, and their availability, have on the local housing market. This project was inspired by news articles discussing the affect airbnb is having on neighbourhoods (e.g. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45083954).

The key findings include: 

- The greatest number of lettings are for entire homes or apprartments (56%)
- Of the category of entire homes or appartments 41% are available for more than 90 days a year (considered high availability by Airbnb)
- The highest number of properties are in the postcode area 'E1'
